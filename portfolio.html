             <p>Madara is undoubtedly one of the strongest shinobi in the ninja world . He was born with an extremely strong chakra , even within the clan, so in connection with his dōjutsu he is one of the few people able to control bijū . He could control Kurama himself and use it in the fight against Hashirama. Based on his struggles and skills, his fame, as well as his status, was so great that his name alone terrified the shinobi. According to Ōnoki, his strength must have been enormous in his heydaythat Madara could have carried out any project, although at the time he had not known how strong Madara actually is. His presence is also reason enough for the Kage to take to the battlefield.  Madara also owns three of the most powerful Kekkei Genkai . In addition, Madara succeeded as the first Shinobi to awaken the Rinnegan after the Rikudō Sennin . He uses all three types of jutsu at the highest level in his fights . He has various defensive techniques, as well as a variety of destructive offensive techniques.

            <p>Mangekyō Sharingan

Madara's consummate Susanoo
Together with his brother Izuna, Madara mastered the Mangekyō Sharingan . But after a while his eyesight deteriorated and he became blind, whereupon he transplanted his little brother's eyes - with his consent - and thus received the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. In the Fourth Ninja World War Madara demonstrates his Susanoo , which differs from the warriors of the other users. The warrior holds a wave-shaped sword in each right hand and appears to be helping Madara with his jutsu. In his Susanoo he has also mastered the ranged combat technique Yasaka no Magatama, which has a high penetrating power. Madara's accomplished Susanoo is far larger than other versions, this one also wears samurai armor and wields a katana. One blow from it is so powerful that it can even split and destroy entire mountains with it. According to Madara, its strength is equal to that of a bijūs . The fight against Hashirama shows that Madara is able to combine the armor and swords of the Susanoo with the Kyūbi.  He is also capable of using Mangekyo Sharingan techniques with the Rinnegan or even entirely without eyes.

            <p>Rinnegan
By combining Ashura's and Indora's powers, Madara managed to awaken the Rinnegan at the end of his life . He can switch between the Rinnegan and his Sharingan forms at will. Like all other users of the Rinnegans, Madara is able to use the Rikudō no Jutsu , whereby he only shows the application of Gakidō . With Gakidō is Madara able Fujutsu Kyūin use can with what he Ninjutsu absorb any kind. With the Rinnegan and his Susanoo, Madara can also make huge meteoritessummon across the battlefield that cause tremendous damage. He also dominates Rinbo: Hengoku with which he could knock down huge beings like the Bijū. With the Rinnegan he can summon the Gedō Mazō and use it with Mazō no Kusari , with which he can suppress and capture all nine Bijū at once. With the Gedō path , Madara is able to create Kuroibō , which he uses in a variety of ways. After receiving his second eye, his Rinneganjutsu are considerably strengthened, for example he can now use Rinbo: Hengoku to create four instead of just one shadow of himself. He can now use Chibaku Tenseiuse, although its application is much more powerful than that of Nagato. In this application, not just one sphere, but several are used. He uses the rock bodies created in this way offensively by using them as meteorites.
